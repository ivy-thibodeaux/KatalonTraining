Mark Selby: Robertson has one of the best techniques in the game. It is very, very straight and he fully commits to every single shot he plays.&#xd;
&#xd;
John Higgins: Every shot is repetitive. He always keeps the same technique and cues through the ball bang straight.&#xd;
&#xd;
Barry Hawkins: Robertson is textbook with his grip and has a ramrod solid cue action, delivering it in a straight line.&#xd;
